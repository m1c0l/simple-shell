CS111 Lab 1a

Code is currently a little sloppy; we will refactor it soon.
We do not close files opened with --rdonly and --wronly because they return -1
somtimes. We do close opened files that we manage internally, and valgrind
reports no memory leaks.

We tried to modularize major functionality and create a simple interface. Our
code is set up so that it should be easy to change to add additional
functionality as we need in the next parts of the lab.
