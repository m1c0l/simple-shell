1a:

Code is currently a little sloppy; we will refactor it soon.
We do not close files opened with --rdonly and --wronly because they return -1
somtimes. We do close opened files that we manage internally, and valgrind
reports no memory leaks.

We tried to modularize major functionality and create a simple interface. Our
code is set up so that it should be easy to change to add additional
functionality as we need in the next parts of the lab.

1b:

We modularized the functionality of our code into several separate files in /src:
filedesc.c, stream.c, command.c, signal_handler.c, util.c, and main.c

We close all file descriptors in the parent, and after we call dup2 to copy
the original file descriptors for the standard streams, we also close the rest
of the file descriptors in the child processes so that pipes won't hang.

1c:

We made --profile output resource usage for every single option after it,
including file options such as --append and --trunc. --profile also outputs
resource usage of child processes being waited on after they exit.
